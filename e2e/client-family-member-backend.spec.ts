/**
 * Adds a family member against a real Fineract.
 *
 * The mocked spec proves what the form shows and sends; only the platform can say whether it
 * agrees. Three questions worth asking it:
 *
 * - does a member added through the form come back, with the relationship and birth date the
 *   operator chose?
 * - is the day the picker now stops at the same day the platform stops at? Asked by taking the
 *   bound off the picker and posting the day after it, so the two are compared rather than both
 *   assumed. No date is hardcoded and no clock is read, which is deliberate: the tenant and the
 *   runner are on different days for part of every day (#758), and a spec that assumed either
 *   one would fail in that window for the wrong reason.
 * - is the relationship marked required because the platform insists, or because the form does?
 *   Both answers are useful, and they differ per field: Fineract's validator demands
 *   `firstName` and `relationshipId`, and accepts a member with no last name. The form asks for
 *   a last name as well, which is its own rule and is marked as such.
