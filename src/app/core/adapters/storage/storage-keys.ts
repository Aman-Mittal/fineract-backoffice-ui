 * Enumerating them is the point. `security.md` §4 treats web storage as a trust boundary, and
 * a boundary nobody can list is one nobody can review: before this, `logout()` cleared the
 * session key and left `fineract_runtime_config` — the API endpoint every subsequent request
 * and every subsequent set of credentials goes to — in place across sign-outs, because no
 * single place knew that key existed. A closed set makes `clearScope` possible, and makes an
 * unlisted key a compile error rather than a discovery.
 *
 * `AGENTS.md` requires `fineract_`-prefixed snake_case keys; the literals below are the
 * enforcement of that rule, not a restatement of it — `theme` was previously stored under a
 * bare `'theme'`, which the rule forbids. No migration shim reads the old key: the cost of
 * the rename is that each existing user's theme falls back to their OS preference once, which
 * `ThemeService` already handles as the no-value case.
